# Traffic Data Analysis 🚀

Project Overview

The Air Traffic Data Analysis project demonstrates advanced SQL-based data analysis to extract insights from flight operations, delays, and passenger trends. This project focuses on query optimization, data cleaning, and performance tuning, key skills required in data-driven environments.

Additionally, this project incorporates AWS RDS integration for cloud-based data management, ensuring scalability and efficiency.

Technologies Used
	•	SQL – Data extraction, transformation, and analysis
	•	AWS RDS – Cloud-hosted relational database for scalability (optional)
	•	MySQL / PostgreSQL – RDBMS used for query execution
	•	Tableau / Power BI (Optional) – For data visualization
	•	Terraform (Optional) – Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to deploy the database

Project Structure

Key Features

✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handles missing values and inconsistencies
✅ Advanced SQL Queries – Uses window functions, CTEs, and subqueries
✅ Optimized Performance – Indexed queries for efficient execution on large datasets
✅ Cloud Integration – Compatible with AWS RDS for remote access
✅ Actionable Insights – Flight delays, passenger trends, and operational efficiency

Setup Instructions

1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Traffic-Data-Analysis.git
cd Traffic-Data-Analysis

2️⃣ Set Up the Database

Create a new database in MySQL or PostgreSQL:

CREATE DATABASE air_traffic_db;

(Optional) If using AWS RDS, replace "your-rds-endpoint" with your actual endpoint:

mysql -h your-rds-endpoint -P 3306 -u your-username -p air_traffic_db

3️⃣ Execute the SQL Script

Run the SQL file to create tables, clean data, and analyze trends:

mysql -u your-username -p air_traffic_db < AirTraffic_Submission.sql

4️⃣ Analyze the Data

After execution, use queries to analyze key insights:

SELECT * FROM flight_delays WHERE year = 2019;

Analysis Details

Flight Delays – Identifies major delay causes by route and time period 
Passenger Trends – Highlights peak travel times and high-demand routes
Operational Efficiency – Suggests airport traffic optimizations
