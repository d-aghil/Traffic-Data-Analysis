# Traffic-Data-Analysis


## Project Overview
The Air Traffic Data Analysis project is designed to demonstrate advanced data analysis and querying capabilities using Structured Query Language (SQL). This project focuses on extracting, transforming, and analyzing air traffic data to uncover meaningful insights related to flight operations, delays, and passenger trends. The aim is to showcase the ability to work with complex datasets and optimize queries for performance, which are critical skills in data-driven environments.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL:** Primary language used for data manipulation, extraction, and analysis.
- **Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS):** The SQL script is compatible with commonly used systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.
- **Optional Visualization Tools:** While this project focuses on SQL-based analysis, the results can be exported to data visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI for enhanced interpretation.

## Project Structure
The repository contains the following structure:

```
AirTraffic_Submission/
└── AirTraffic_Submission.sql  -  Contains all SQL queries, data cleaning steps, and analysis.
```

## Features and Key Highlights
- Detailed data cleaning processes to handle inconsistencies and missing values.
- Use of advanced SQL concepts such as window functions, common table expressions (CTEs), and subqueries to perform complex analyses.
- Optimization of queries for improved efficiency when working with large datasets.
- Comprehensive analysis covering trends in flight delays, passenger volumes, and airport operations.
- Well-documented code with descriptive comments to ensure maintainability and ease of understanding.

## Setup Instructions
Follow the steps below to set up and execute the project:

### 1. Clone the Repository
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AirTraffic_Submission.git
cd AirTraffic_Submission
```

### 2. Set Up the Database
Before running the SQL script, set up a new database in your preferred SQL environment:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE air_traffic_db;
USE air_traffic_db;
```

### 3. Execute the SQL Script
Run the provided SQL script to create necessary tables, clean data, and perform the analysis. You can do this via your SQL client or the command line:

```bash
mysql -u your-username -p air_traffic_db < AirTraffic_Submission.sql
```

### 4. Review and Analyze the Results
After executing the script, you can query the newly created tables and views to review the analysis results. The script includes sections on:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Flight delay trend analysis.
- Passenger traffic analysis per airport.
- Peak hour identification for flight operations.
- Recommendations based on data findings.

## Analysis Details
The project investigates several key areas of interest:
- **Flight Delays:** Identifies the primary causes and frequency of delays across different time periods and routes.
- **Passenger Trends:** Examines passenger counts to highlight peak travel times and high-traffic routes.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Analyzes airport traffic data to provide recommendations for resource allocation.

## Why This Project Is Relevant
This project highlights practical SQL skills that are directly applicable to real-world scenarios. By focusing on efficient query writing and thorough data analysis, it demonstrates the ability to derive actionable insights from raw data. The structured approach ensures that anyone reviewing the code can easily understand the logic and reasoning behind each step, making it a valuable addition to any data-driven organization.
