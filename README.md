# Traffic Data Analysis

Project Overview

The Air Traffic Data Analysis project focuses on extracting, transforming, and analyzing air traffic data using SQL. The goal is to uncover insights related to flight operations, delays, and passenger trends. This project demonstrates query optimization, data cleaning, and performance tuning, ensuring efficiency when handling large datasets. It also integrates with AWS RDS for cloud-based data management.

## Technologies Used

	•	SQL – Data extraction, transformation, and analysis
	•	AWS RDS – Cloud-hosted relational database
	•	MySQL / PostgreSQL – Relational database management system
	•	Tableau / Power BI (Optional) – Data visualization
	•	Terraform (Optional) – Infrastructure as Code for cloud deployment

## Project Structure

	Traffic-Data-Analysis/
	├── AirTraffic_Submission.sql   # SQL queries for data analysis
	└── README.md                   # Project documentation

## Key Features
- Data cleaning processes to handle inconsistencies and missing values.

- Use of advanced SQL concepts such as window functions, common table expressions (CTEs), and subqueries.

- Query optimization techniques for performance improvement.
  
- Cloud integration for scalable and efficient data management.

- Analysis covering flight delays, passenger trends, and airport operations.


## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository

		git clone https://github.com/your-username/Traffic-Data-Analysis.git
		cd Traffic-Data-Analysis

2. Set Up the Database

Create a new database in MySQL or PostgreSQL:

	CREATE DATABASE air_traffic_db;

If using AWS RDS, replace "your-rds-endpoint" with your actual endpoint:

	mysql -h your-rds-endpoint -P 3306 -u your-username -p air_traffic_db

3. Execute the SQL Script

Run the SQL file to create tables, clean data, and analyze trends:

	mysql -u your-username -p air_traffic_db < AirTraffic_Submission.sql

4. Analyze the Data

Query the database to explore the insights:

	SELECT * FROM flight_delays WHERE year = 2019;

## Analysis Details

- Flight Delays: Identifies primary causes and frequency of delays

- Passenger Trends: Highlights peak travel times and high-traffic routes

- Operational Efficiency: Provides recommendations for airport traffic optimization


## Why This Project Matters

- Demonstrates practical SQL skills applicable in real-world data environments

- Designed for cloud integration with AWS RDS

- Optimized for scalability and efficiency

Future Improvements

- Implement Terraform for automated cloud deployment
  
- Use Airflow for scheduling ETL pipelines

- Expand data visualization with Tableau and Power BI
